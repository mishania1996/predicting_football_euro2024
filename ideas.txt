Idea for predicting result of Euro Games:
The dataframe  will be indexed by a triple of 2 teams and a date.
The label is a multiclass: win/draw/defeat (?). Think here more, is the triple
in the index ordered or not. What does it mean to be home-team or away team.
The feature will be players described by their clubs as a ranking in fifa. (Maybe
to include the manager somehow?)
Other important features to include?
